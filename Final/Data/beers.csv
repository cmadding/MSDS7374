One result of the treaty was Catherine’s development of a personal affinity for London Stout, which Henry Thrale brewed in his Anchor Brewery in Southwark for export to the Russian Imperial Court. English and Irish breweries produce several Stout styles such as Oatmeal, Sweet, Dry, Foreign, and Imperial, but the United States is now the largest producer of Imperial Stout. That should come as no surprise for a malted beverage that exudes bold and complex flavors, creamy richness, and an attitude suggestive of perfection in every way.

208827,Bull Creek Brewing ,1168559,Tommy Raj IPA,IPA - English,7.75,60,"Beginning in the late 18th century, English brewers crafted pale ales specifically for export to British occupiers in India. Use of the term “India Pale Ale” (IPA) first appeared in print in 1829, and referred to pale ale that was heavily malted, highly hopped, and sporting higher alcohol levels than its English pale ale cousins. The exaggerated characteristics of the IPA style were thought to preserve the brew during its long voyage to India. Bow Brewery was the preferred IPA producer for the East India Company, although many other breweries produced the style for export and domestic consumption as well. Some accounts of the British occupational periods claim a portion of each shipment was watered down for the army troops, while the remaining full-strength portions were destined for the enjoyment of officers and British Elite. Hops are the dominant force in our Tommy Raj® IPA. Expect a bold, uniquely flavorful brew with a solid malt foundation supporting a strong, citrus hop presence.

Arguably, EPAs are the closest ale style to resemble lager beer, with light yellow to gold color and mellow distinction. FADED® is the BCBC presentation of a great Hill Country Extra Pale Ale.

However, it is not designed to blow your head off with overpowering hop bitterness.  Instead, Mosaic IPA is an extremely well-balanced brew that showcases its unique hop aroma and flavor. This beer gets its name from a new hop variety named “Mosaic,” which is predominantly where the immense, raw hop aroma and flavor is derived.

One of treasures made by these breweries and nearly lost to history was spiced witbier (white beer). Witbier defied an untimely fate, being revived by a man named Pierre Celis who worked in one of the last breweries in Belgium to commercially produce a version of this unique, spiced beer. Celis eventually sold his own witbier brewery and moved to Austin, Texas to open another white beer brewery (Celis White) and the rest is history. ? In honor of the late and great Pierre Celis, we are proud to offer Community Wit as a warm weather libation, produced locally for our fellow Texans once again. We brew it traditionally using unmalted wheat as our base and lightly spice the kettle with freshly ground sweet and bitter orange peel and coriander seed. The hops are minimal, keeping the focus on the wheat, spices and the unique character contributed by authentic Belgian yeast strains, one of which originated from the same strain that Pierre brought across the Atlantic to America.",3.62,10757

Public Ale's name is an ode to a sessionable style that not only has been commonly found in English public houses for centuries, but can be enjoyed today by everyone within our Community.

​Extra Special Bitter was originally brewed by the English brewery Fuller, Smith & Turner of London (Fuller’s ESB) in the mid 20th century as a winter ale. At Community Beer Company we appreciate this timeless, quaffable beer style and will bring it to you year round as our “Public Ale.”

In reverence to the best ESB’s of England, we brew it with nearly all English ingredients: 100% English malts, a blend of English, German and American hops, our house ale English yeast strain and of course our own crystal clear, filtered water.

The subtle complexities of this beer begin with a base of 100% Maris Otter English pale malt – prized for its superior, rich, bready taste – which adds a malt complexity that is difficult to achieve with modern, higher yielding malt varieties. English crystal malt increases the malt complexity, brings amber color and some residual sweetness, all of which mingles well with the fully expressed fruity esters developed by our house ale yeast during fermentation.

Marked by a senseless, disorienting, often menacing complexity.
Marked by surreal distortion and often a sense of impending danger.
We took the definition of Kafkaesque seriously when we created this beer.  Our brewers viewed it as a challenge to create a beer so complex and bizarre that it would make Franz himself proud.  We started with an Imperial IPA, then we transformed it into a rye IPA with a menacing portion of rye malt.  Then, we made it disorientingly black with some heavily roasted malts.  We needed more complexity, so we made it surreally smoky with cherry-wood smoked malts.  Lastly, we added 300 lbs of raspberries for fruitiness, and everybody knows you can’t have a complex beer without wood, so we let sit on toasted American oak.  We know that you will find this Imperial Smoked Black Rye Oaked Raspberry IPA to be very Kafkaesque.",3.803,3098

More than anything, we wanted it to be a beer that the band would want to drink while they played music.  We sat down with the band and tasted several beers together.  They loved the hop flavor in the Imperial Texan, so thats where we started with this recipe.  We wanted something lower in alcohol so it could be enjoyed from the opening act until the epic Toadies encore.  We built the recipe with caramel and Munich malts to give the beer a solid malty flavor, a bold red color, and 5% alcohol.  We went easy on the bittering hops and heavy on the flavor hops to give it just the right amount tropical fruit and piney flavor.  Lastly, we serenaded the yeast with non-stop Toadies music to give it just hint of Rock ‘n’ Roll. This is how the official beer of the Toadies, Rubberneck Red, was born.  Its an easy-drinking, refreshing beer with enough flavor to get excited about.

While there are various accounts of other ingredients used, there is a common thread of honey, oats, wheat, and molasses - which all sound delicious to us!

It is malt-forward with elements of caramel and the sweetness of light brown sugar, balanced nicely by a combination of floral hops and a noticeable alcohol bite. It's a sturdy brew with a smooth character which belies both an inner strength and a slightly full body, along with a moderate bitterness to round out the taste.",3.909,25215
13688,Peticolas Brewing Company,446746,Sit Down Or I'll Sit You Down,IPA - Imperial / Double,10.0,90,"Back in the day, Michael Peticolas' brother, Charlie, was a cop and COPS filmed a few of his arrests.     The best of which involved a deadbeat considering resistance to his arrest.   With baton drawn, Charlie demanded ""Sit down or I'll SIT YOU DOWN!""   Since the episode aired over 10 years ago, we've uttered the line a million times to one another and laughed every time.   We're paying tribute to that line by using it to name our Imperial IPA.   A big beer that will sit you down if you don't do it first.   Ha.   Call it â€œSit Downâ€ for short.
As for the beer itself, the intent is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of the hops.   We dry hopped it with over a pound of hops per barrel of beer.   Itâ€™s gold in color and the floral ester aroma is high.   The hop bitterness is high,   but not at all   harsh.   The hop flavor is high, fresh, and lively.   Yet with all of our beers, itâ€™s all about balance and this one is no exception.   The malt character is fairly high and provides a tremendously full mouthfeel.   Finally, the alcohol in this beer is intentionally present (and delicious).    
When it comes to food pairing, IPAâ€™s are best when paired with spice.   Indian foods are often complex and focus on spices and herbs.   As a consequence, the hop aromatics of the IPA can result in great harmony with spicy Indian dishes.   Otherwise, find yourself some spicy Thai or jerk chicken.",4.029,10594

13688,Peticolas Brewing Company,73612,Great Scot!,Scottish Ale,6.8,24,"The Great Scot! is characterized by its dark copper color, thick tan head, and slight malty sweet aroma. It is a medium bodied malt forward beer with low bitterness and possesses a nutty, soft and chewy character in flavor and mouthfeel. A slight peaty/smoky characteristic is also present at low levels, but ultimately, this is a clean beer that finishes relatively dry.",3.87,5661
13688,Peticolas Brewing Company,711159,Thrilla In Brazilla,IPA - American,7.5,75,"Thrilla in Brazilla is gold in color with a tight white head of foam.  The fruity-ester aroma is high to very high.  Hop aroma is further characterized by high amounts of citrus with a slightly resinous character in the background.  The aroma follows through to the taste with citrusy characters dancing on the palette, including the presence of fresh oranges.  Thrilla is a medium bodied beer with medium high hop bitterness.  As always, this beer is balanced. We brewed this American IPA specifically for the 2014 Brazil World Cup. Thrilla in Brazilla will be released June 12, 2014, the day of World Cup match 1 between Brazil and Croatia.  The beer will initially feature at pubs agreeing to show a match watching party for the opener.  We will then release the beer to the rest of the market and it will remain available until July 12, the day of the World Cup final. Food pairing?  A nice thick juicy hamburger with fresh jalepeno and serrano peppers.  The spice in the burger pairs amazingly well with the crisp citrusy hop character of Thrilla in Brazilla.",3.802,4419
13688,Peticolas Brewing Company,1622253,TOO SOON,IPA - American,7.5,75,"TOO SOON is an IPA brewed with a ‘back to basics’ approach.  Rather than formulate a recipe using the newest and trendiest methods, we used the traditional methods and techniques that are the foundation for some of our earlier beers (e.g., Velvet Hammer, Royal Scandal, Sit Down).  Our typical base two row pale malt is accentuated with a minimal amount of light crystal malt and we turned to three of our most tried and true hops…Centennial, Cascade, and Amarillo.  The brewhouse hop regimen for TOO SOON mirrors that of the earlier referenced beers and three are dry hopped in the same manner as well.  Will this beer turn out as well as Hammer, Scandal, and Sit Down?  Does the beer name answer the question?",3.839,3672

That move is called the “Irish Goodbye” and is the name we’ve bestowed upon our Irish Red Ale.  It is a beautiful copper red in color with low fruity-ester aroma accompanied by a rocky dense off white head.  Candy like malt sweetness is enhanced by a subtle degree of roasted malt that brings a level of complexity to nice even keeled hop flavor and bitterness.    ,3.804,3391
13688,Peticolas Brewing Company,383965,The DUKE,Barleywine - English,12.0,35,"Straw in color with a dissipating white that leaves plenty of lacing, The DUKE appears lighter than your typical barley wine. Even though dry hopped, the high alcohol renders the hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness low to medium low. Complex alcohols and fruity-ester characters are noticeable and balanced with the high alcohol content. Be careful with this one, the 12% alcohol will sneak up on you after just 12 ounces. The DUKE is the Truth.",3.997,3164
13688,Peticolas Brewing Company,848745,A Lost Epic,Belgian Tripel,11.0,25,"Our Tripel has a sunny golden-orange color with rocky white head. A complex, mild spice accentuates a light fruity-ester aroma while the overall hop aroma remains low. The use of pale malts result in brisk malty palate containing a hint of sweetness in the center, but with a light dry finish. Hop bitterness is medium and tends to equalize the balance of malt. The alcohol strength and flavor is clearly evident. Our Tripel’s medium body and high alcohol content contribute a pleasant vanilla like creaminess. This beer is highly carbonated to bring flavor to the forefront. As this beer warms, its flavors flourish. What’s in a beer name? In this case, the brewery’s name. A LOST EPIC is an anagram of PETICOLAS. Tripels lend themselves well to herbs, especially thyme. The herbal notes in the hop aromatics pair nicely with the herbs used in the food dish.",3.957,2572
13688,Peticolas Brewing Company,1246136,Come And Take It,Kölsch,5.0,30,"Not only do we favor beer names that double as commands, but “Come and Take It” is best known as a battle cry from the American and Texas Revolutions signifying defiance against tyrants.  What better way to show our Texas pride and defiance of beer tyrants than by crafting a flavorful beer in celebration of the Texas State Fair?  

Our Koslch serves as the basis for “Come and Take It,” but the similarities between the two beers end there due to an aggressive use of cascade hops that completely change this beer’s character.  Although we’ve added nearly a pound and half of cascade per barrel to a tettnang hopped beer, the execution and manner of the cascade addition in a cohesive and seamless manner is what “Come and Take It” is all about.  Tettnang imparts spicy and earthy characteristics while also subtly contributing fruity, floral, citrus notes; whereas cascade is primarily classified as a fruity floral hop with a hint of spice.  Emphasizing tettnang early and cascade hops late results in huge fruity citrus notes that dominate both “Come and Take It’s” aroma and flavor.  The more you drink it, the more you’ll enjoy it.  Weighing in at 5% ABV, we trust you’ll find this one refreshing beer.

Adding ghost peppers into a fermenter full of Alfred Brown gives this beer a wicked twist.  Notes of tobacco, chocolate, and malt sweetness give way to a slow building warming sensation imparted by the infamous ghost pepper chili.  Consistent with our brewing philosophy, we deliver flavors associated with the ghost pepper in a subtle manner so as to enhance the underlying character of our traditional Alfred Brown.  You’ll recognize the ghost pepper’s presence with your first sip, but the uniqueness of this beer shines as you empty your glass.  Expect to experience  a growing, yet always pleasant, sensation of warmth on the palate, in the throat and down to the stomach.  The Ghost of Alfred Brown will continue to haunt you even after you’ve moved on.  A slow burn never tasted so good.

13688,Peticolas Brewing Company,2028725,Good Call,Blonde Ale,6.3,41,"Temperatures start rising in spring and are blistering by summer.  We all have methods for staying cool, but nothing beats the heat better than a crisp and refreshing beer.  We crafted Good Call to demonstrate.
Our summer ale features Denali, Centennial, Azacca and a touch of ginger that complements the beer’s malt bill.  A generous amount of white wheat adds a slight sweetness and provides a medium body typical of the style.
The blending of hops create aromas of lemon peel, citrus and a light breadiness. The combination of ginger and citrusy hops creates a crisp bite that quickly fades into a round sweetness.  As carbonation is released on the palate, you’ll experience flavors of orange and pineapple while ginger provides a gentle spice in the background.
Good Call is exactly what the name implies, a positive reinforcement of your superior decision.  Make a Good Call.",3.57,1599
13688,Peticolas Brewing Company,1877466,Turn Out the Lights,Stout - Irish Dry,6.0,30,"Turn Out the Lights, an Irish Dry Stout, was brewed to commemorate our first 5 years.  Although known for brewing high alcohol beers, we’re mixing it up this year with a nice 6% stout.  A jet black appearance and thick head define this beer’s rich character and the use of coffee-like roasted barley heavily influences the aroma.  While the flavor is initially accentuated by light caramel, it finishes with a distinctive dry-roast bitterness.  Pleasant, but gentle and subtle fruit esters are overshadowed by the malt, bittering hop, and roasted barley character.  You’ll actually find the body of Turn Out the Lights fairly light.

Our penchant for names with multiple meanings is on display again with Turn Out the Lights – its deep black color naturally invokes ‘lights out’ imagery, we’ll literally turn out the lights on 2016 with the New Year’s Eve release of this beer, and it references the musical shenanigans heard in the brewery and highlighted during our crew’s 2015 holiday party.",3.742,1522

Prime Minister appears dark orange with complex fruity esters contributing to the aroma.  Its medium bodied with a malty/caramelly sweetness.  Hop flavor is present and bitterness is light, but evident and balanced with the malt flavors present.

The beer’s lack of clarity can be traced back to a hefty amount of flaked oats in the malt bill and massive post boil hop additions. Six pounds of El Dorado, Azacca and Amarillo per barrel went into this double dry hopped Hazy IPA and it’s evident.

Huge notes of tangerine, mango and pineapple are immediately present and dominate the forefront. Behind the intensely fruity aroma is a hint of pine which adds complexity to the lingering aromatics.",3.95,1318

Also present is a healthy amount of flaked barley to yield a full and pleasant mouthfeel. As for hops, we used Golding and Cascade to compliment the sweetness and lend a slight fruity herbal quality to the beer.

The end result is a delicious ale that pours deep ruby black with a full creamy tan head, best enjoyed after a long satisfying work day. Pleasant notes of light malt sweetness in the aroma play nicely with roasty coffee and chocolate and a hint of toffee. After a first sip, you are greeted with more complex roasted malt flavors, reminiscent of cocoa.",3.765,1027

The first sip of this unique ale provokes an immediate association with a variety of different sodas. The medium/high carbonation level reinforces the flavors present and will send you down memory lane.

Generous amounts of crystal and high quality English 2-row lay the foundation for our traditional red ale. Cascade and Simcoe hops provide fruity notes to the aroma while adding citrus and pine flavors, as well as a gentle bitterness that balances out the beer’s sweet caramel backbone.

Originally produced in an era without the benefits of modern refrigeration, a hybrid style of lager emerged that was fermented at temperatures typically reserved for ale yeasts. The end result was a medium-bodied beer with a lager-clean malt character and a subtle fruitiness derived from its time at these warmer fermentation temperatures. Pinsetter is brewed using the finest American 2-row and caramel malts, with a touch of roasted malt for a rich amber color.

2940,Saint Arnold Brewing Company,1482801,5 O'Clock Pils,Pilsner - Czech,5.2,40,"5 O’Clock Pils starts with the distinctive Saaz hop nose, then a pleasant maltiness for such a light beer, followed by a floral, spicy and earthy hop flavor that closes with a focused bitter finish. It is very refreshing. 

The inspiration for this beer comes from hop buying trips to the Czech Republic. The unfiltered, unpasteurized pilsners that you find there at the birthplace of the style gave the idea of recreating that same beer, but with an increased emphasis on the flavor and aromatic qualities of the hops.

We use one malt (pils) and one hop (Saaz) in brewing the beer. The maltiness is derived from the decoction mash, a traditional and rarely used method for heating the mash by removing a portion of the mash, boiling it, and then mixing it back in. The boiling causing caramelization that deepens the beers color and lowers the fermentability of the sugars resulting in a slightly richer bodied beer. Saaz hops are the only hop used in brewing that have never been hybridized, dating back to when hops were first used in brewing hundreds of years ago.

This beer is best enjoyed at 40° to 55°F.",3.579,10149
2940,Saint Arnold Brewing Company,519439,Boiler Room,Sour - Berliner Weisse,3.7,4,"Boiler Room is a light bodied but surprisingly flavorful sour wheat beer. The sourness is created by souring the wort prior to boiling and fermentation (unlike Belgian-style sours which sour during fermentation and have active bacteria in them when packaged). The nose of the beer has a light Hersbrucker hop note and a distinct funkiness. The taste is sweet malt quickly going into a tart body and finish. The sour and malt flavors balance well all the way through creating a very refreshing beverage, akin to drinking a tart lemonade or limeade. For a beer with just over 3.5%, it creates a big experience for the palate.

Traditionally this beer is enjoyed either straight or with raspberry or woodruff syrup to sweeten it (and turn it red or green, respectively).",3.451,9608

To this, there is a dryhop addition of Citra hops that amps everything up. The nose is citrus and spices with a light banana. There is a pleasant round body that is light and creamy. The citrus of the orange peel blends nicely with the citrus from the hops and the coriander creates a liveliness on the finish.

2940,Saint Arnold Brewing Company,1422441,Divine Reserve No. 16,Old Ale,10.0,44,"Divine Reserve No. 16 is an Adambier. It is a full-bodied beer with a prominent, but not overpowering, smoked wood aroma (almost like a campfire), which comes from the use of Rauchmalt. There is a subtle Noble hop aroma and a slight caramel character that becomes more prominent as the beer warms up. The smokiness dominates through the crisp, Kolsch yeast inspired, finish. DR16 has a moderately high bitterness that is balanced nicely by its residual malty sweetness, and there is no lack of alcohol warmness as you easily finish a pint.

Adambier was a popular beer style in Dortmund, Germany until the mid-19th century, when Pilsners and Munich-style lagers began to take over. Eventually, the style became largely extinct until recently.",3.905,7043

2940,Saint Arnold Brewing Company,1886233,Divine Reserve No. 17,Porter - Baltic,9.2,47,"If you travel from England to Russia through the Baltic Sea you might get a sense of the origins of the Baltic Porter. It is a beer that pulls on the traditions of the British Porter, the Russian Imperial Stout and the lagers of Central Europe. The style dates back to the 18th century.

Divine Reserve No. 17 is a big, rich porter that is deceptively drinkable and well balanced for its 9.2% ABV. It has a pleasant sweetness that balances the roastiness of the beer without being cloying. We achieved this by using a combination of malts - Munich malt as the base, Chocolate Wheat and Brown malts for color and roastiness, and flaked oats to round out the body.

A healthy amount of Perle hops creates a balancing bitterness that is disguised by the body of the beer. The Old Bavarian lager yeast used in this beer is the same yeast used in 5 O' Clock Pils, Spring Bock and Summer Pils. This is the first lager we've brewed for the Divine Reserve series. 

Divine Reserve No. 17 is best served at 50",4.078,4852
2940,Saint Arnold Brewing Company,2507700,Divine Reserve No. 18,Stout - Imperial / Double,13.4,48,"For DR18, we used a grain bill that required four times the amount of grain as Fancy Lawnmower, dosed in two additions of Belgian candi syrup during fermentation to provide an adrenaline shot to the yeast, and let the beer rest for three months before adding a small amount of Madagascar vanilla beans as an added layer of complexity.

The beer pours a rich darkness – no light passes through – topped with a mocha colored head. The aroma is filled with molasses, vanilla, baker’s chocolate, and rich dark fruit from our house yeast. The flavor profile starts with rich chocolate and raspberries that are dipped in honey, then builds on dried dark cherry notes, and finishes with wine like silkiness.",4.139,3874

2940,Saint Arnold Brewing Company,1610394,Bishop's Barrel No. 14,Stout - Russian Imperial,12.1,33,"The base beer for Bishop’s Barrel No. 14 is a cult favorite, the Russian Imperial Stout recipe used for both Divine Reserve No. 5 and 15. The original beer is rich with chocolate, toffee and roast. With BB14, we wanted to explore the complexity of balancing these flavors while going a bit further and adding a new element, coffee. To do this, we first aged the beer in Woodford Reserve bourbon barrels for eleven months, where it picked up notes of oak, vanilla, coconut and bourbon.

After this, we partnered again with our friends at Java Pura to find a roast that complements the flavors. After several trials, we selected the Espresso blended roast. The completed blend with the coffee addition subdued the overwhelming alcohol heat that is typical of the Russian Imperial Stout and brought balance to a style that is usually defined by being unbalanced. ",4.38,3809
2940,Saint Arnold Brewing Company,1759094,Bishop's Barrel No. 15,Barleywine - English,13.1,28,"Barleywine aged in Rye Whiskey Barrels

The base beer for Bishop’s Barrel No. 15 is an English Barleywine. The style focuses on malt complexity, rather than hops like an American Barleywine. The appearance is blood red with a thin, off-white head that lingers. Aroma is rich with deep caramel malt, toffee, and dark fruit notes. The rye whiskey character brings out more spice and oak than a bourbon barrel aged beer, which typically lends more coconut and vanilla. The high alcohol does not hide itself, but remains in balance with the thick body of the beer. While the beer coats the glass, it also coats the throat and mouth.

This is to be enjoyed over a long session so as not to rush the blossom of subtle floral characters in the aroma as the beer warms. When swirled, the rich malt and whiskey comes out and reminds you this is a beverage to be patient with and enjoyed slowly. This beer is ready to enjoy now, however it's built to age gracefully with proper cellaring.

Enjoy between 55° and 65°. ",4.305,3584

During my time helping 5 Stones transition into their new brewery, I've proclaimed the merits of Pilsner beers; their historical relevance, the difficulty of their construction and execution, and ultimately their drinkability. After much deliberation, discussion, and help from many friends we brewed a German-style Keller Pils of our own, utilizing two vacant horizontal fermentation vessels intended for the production of fruit beer in the warmer months. Keller Pils, or unfiltered Pilsner, deviates a bit from the idea many conjure up when thinking of Pilsner. Being unfiltered, it still contains some yeast leftover from fermentation. It is somewhat cloudy, textured, and softer in the presence of it's yeast. Furthermore, it presents more fermentation character than its filtered counterparts. In this beer, one may find aromas and flavors of biscuit dough, bitter greens, fresh cut hay, sulphur, tarragon and chamomile. Some of those descriptors may seem strange, or unwelcome in a glass of beer, but in this case the whole is truly greater than the sum of it's parts. And the beauty of these types of beers is that one can simply drink it.

We ferment on the cooler side to let the clove character come through, but there are still hints of banana as well.

We use a blend of rye, barley, and wheat to completely round out the flavor and bring back the traditional feel of a Sahti. We use an antique wheat from Germany that has remained unchanged for hundreds of years. We smoke a small percentage of the grains over pecan wood in order to draw away from the juniper flavor. There is a focus on keeping the additions light enough that the smoke flavor only really comes out after your sip, not on the palate with the flavors of the ale itself. As with a traditional Sahti, the grains are filtered through a bed of juniper that we trim off of local trees the day we brew. We also add in crushed juniper berries to improve the juniper flavor without adding too much of a resin taste from the branches. In place of Finnish baking yeast, we use Belgian Saison yeast to add the peppery, clover, and bready characteristics that are traditionally attributed to this style of ale.
We can't guarantee that this is anything like what the vikings would have drank, but enough research and planning has gotten us a fantastic ale that, Viking or not...will make you want to smash heads..",3.578,320

The key to this beer is that we used actual dinosaurs bones. Okay, that was a lie. But we did throw enough hops in here to bury a        Brontosaurus. Inspired by some of our favorite West Coast IPAs the bold pine, citrus, peach, and tangerine hop flavors along with a clean bitterness are balanced by that velvety malt backbone. This beautiful blend of flavor and drinkability showcases the truly unique Eureka! hops, which we find to be wonderfully juicy and dank. If you want a brew that'll scratch your  hop itch, you've come to the right place. You don't need tiny arms and a huge head to enjoy this mammoth IPA!

Belgian-Style Abbey Ale

We use traditional Belgian malts and candi sugar to create a complex aroma of raisins and plums, with a hint of cherry. These aromas carry over into the flavor profile, and the addition of Belgian Trappist yeast adds yet another layer of complexity. Belgian candi sugar give an impression of sweetness, but leaves the finish quite dry. The dark fruit flavors meld with the slight banana and clove notes imparted by the yeast, creating a classic example of the style. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do!

Logro Farms is located just a few hundred yards from Jester King Brewery at Ceres Park Ranch. Snörkel takes partial inspiration from traditional German Gose. Like Gose, it’s moderate in alcohol, brewed with malted wheat and salt, and has some acidity or sourness in the flavor profile. We specifically used both sea salt and alderwood smoked sea salt, and fermented Snörkel (like all our beer) with a blend of brewers yeast, naturally occurring wild yeast, and native souring bacteria, the last of which lends the beer its acidity. But Gose only served as a jumping off point. From there, we set out to explore the savory characteristics of umami through use of the oyster mushrooms.",3.794,7826

5291,Jester King Brewery,739264,Detritivore,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,5.5,0,"Detritivore was made by adding the same cherries that were used to make Montmorency vs. Balaton to fresh beer in stainless steel and allowing the combined beer and fruit to referment to dryness. This was the same technique that we originally used to make La Vie en Rose with the raspberries from Atrial Rubicite. As with La Vie en Rose, the second refermentation of the fruit results in subtler, more delicate flavors, as compared with the more intense flavors that result from the initial refermentation. Detritivore is also among the first Jester King beers to be brewed with aged hops that were matured for an extended period of time in a horse barn approximately 300 yards from the brewery. Aged hops are traditionally used in the production of authentic Belgian Lambic. The aging process preserves the antiseptic properties of the hops, which serve to fend off unfriendly microorganisms, while significantly reducing the bittering components. Detritivore is fermented using native yeast and bacteria from the Texas Hill Country, but is not spontaneously fermented, as our brewers actively introduce our house blend of saccharomyces, native wild yeast, and souring bacteria to the wort, rather than relying on inoculation by ambient, airborne microorganisms. The grist for Detritivore was composed of malted barely and malted wheat. It is 5.5% alcohol by volume, with a finishing gravity of 1.000 and is 3.4 pH at the time of bottling.",4.142,5578

We brewed our version of Cerveza Sin Frontera at our brewery in October 2013 with the help of Chad Yakobson of Crooked Stave and Raphaël Mettler of Trois Dames. The wort, brewed with Hill Country well water, barley, wheat, oats, and hops, was initially fermented in stainless steel for three months, then refermented in Spanish sherry barrels for twelve months, and finally refermented in bottles, kegs, and casks for three more months.

The inspiration for the beer came from two sources. In making Kollaborationsbier, we brewed a low gravity wort at Live Oak with Head Brewer Dusan Kwiatkowski. The wort was prepared using a traditional decoction mash, beginning with undermodified pilsner malt and then working it vigorously by separating out a portion of the mash, boiling it in the kettle, and then returning it to the mash tun. We then added a few hefty doses of Czech hops to the boil for a firm bitterness and floral, spicy hop aromas and flavors. After brewing and cooling the wort, we racked it into portable tanks and drove it from east Austin to the outskirts of town in the Texas Hill Country where Jester King Brewery is located, transferred it into one of our fermentation tanks, and inoculated it with our unique mixed culture of brewer’s yeast and naturally occurring wild yeast and bacteria.

This one is brewed to Bavarian style. However, we love the citrusy guava notes of Cashmere hops from New Zealand hops and felt they would create a perfect backdrop for the
yeast and wheat.  It’s the firsts that you will never forget. The first kiss, the first lover, the first beer. One sunny, and warm day, after a long morning and afternoon hiking
with friends up and down the Kampenwand (near Aschau, Germany) we were thirsty and hungry. Like good Germans do, we ended up in a little Tavern at the foot of the mountain and ordered Pretzels, radishes, meat and Obazda.
Someone bought the first round of beer, and to my horror, I was confronted with an unusually large glass of golden, milky and frothy liquid – Hefeweizen!  Beer seemed bitter and unapproachable to my young palate, but as we said
“Prost!” I decided to politely suck it up - literally. Surprisingly this reminded me of the aromas wafting out of a German bakery or Konditorei; aromas of fresh baked crusty bread, sweet tarts, fruits and spices. What was not to like
about these flavors and aromas? And so I enjoyed my very first beer. We hope this one transports you to the Bakeries of Germany.

Chamuco is a Spanish term for “devil” and is used to describe a mischievious person.  It is a perfect name for this beer because it plays with your taste buds and tongue in so many different ways.

We utilized the proprietary Pink Boots Hop Blend (Palisade, Citra, Simcoe, Mosaic, Loral), which was the parameter for the 2018 Pink Boots collab beer.  The hops smelled like strawberries, so we decided to throw real strawberries at it.  Then we thought it needed a hint of vanilla, so we threw a bunch of vanilla beans in.  This made us think of Strawberry Shortcake without the cake, so we added wheat, lactose sugar and oats.  Finally we finished it off with some more hops – because there’s never enough.
A portion of the brew’s proceeds will be donated to the Pink Boots Society International for educational scholarships, and as a big thank you for having provided our Brewster with one of these scholarships.  Cheers to all the amazing women in our craft.

Boss Ass Bitch (noun)–a woman that takes no sh-t,but does take names. Although she may not be “flawless” like Beyonce, she certainly holds her head up high like a Goddess, and surrounds herself with the people who care about her, while standing up for those she loves. She has no problem telling all the naysayers and back stabbers to GTFO. She may fall every so often, only to get up stronger.   She may not always be the most confident, but she can certainly fake it until she makes it.

Thank goodness, because now we can drink beer for big ideas and coffee to get them done – all at the same time.
This is a Robust Porter base with lots of malty, chocolate undertones, perfect for the 30 lbs of coffee we added.  
 
 
We try to support local business if at all possible.  For this brew we wanted to highlight White Elephant Coffee Company for their amazing coffee roasting abilities.  It was fun sitting down in their eclectic shop, to decide on a blend for the Tejano.  These guys are as passionate about coffee as we are about beer. We agreed on a blend of Mexico-Chiapas and Colombia-Tolima.

No…I promise I didn’t inhale, I only swallowed.  

So let your hair or beard down, take a deep breath, this one’s okay to inhale, and great to swallow, although we recommend sipping, and sniffing.

This is like a sandstorm of flavors in your face.  Yes, the Brewster listens to German Techno quite a bit, but then technically Darude is not German, and Sandstorm is more trance - which makes total sense, because this beer may just put you in a trance.  So don't be rude, have another.  

Did you know that Equanot used to be Equinox?  Apparently this poor hop had to change names due to a trademark dispute over the name Equinox.  It's hard to find a straight answer about whom the dispute was with; there's some talk of it being with Lagunitas Brewing Company and their Equinox beer other's point to Equinox Brewing Company.  Oh why so teknikal?",3.862,368
101164,Künstler Brewing,2358716,Sichuan,Belgian Strong Golden Ale,8.4,42,"A balanced Belgian ale with a warm front and zesty aroma. 

It is a popular practice of many Belgian brewers to toss in things like orange peel, and coriander into their brew. While this addition may be to the dismay of the famously purist Germans (to include the Brewster’s beer loving father), it can add an incomparable depth of flavor and aroma. Feeling creative, we brewed this beer with Sichuan peppercorns. While the name might instill fear into the taste buds of the spice sensitive, fear not! The addition of the Sichuan merely creates a tingle on the tongue, followed by bright and lemony overtones",3.746,356
101164,Künstler Brewing,2567862,Kali Fog,IPA - Imperial / Double,7.7,69,"We brewed this one for Karl The Fog.  “Who is Karl?” you ask. While many personify the characteristics of Fog, San Franciscans have gone as far as to name it “Karl the Fog”.  Karl the Fog has become omnipresent in the imaginations of many in the Bay Area.  According to Twitter, Karl is more popular than Clint Eastwood.  With 331K followers, @KarlTheFog is a social media sensation.  Just the other day, Karl tweeted, ‘Go home, Wind, you’re drunk.’  Well we think Karl himself needs a beer, because, in Karl’s words, “All that is sunny does not glitter, and not all those in the fog are lost.”  Of course you can call this beer Karl the Fog.  We would have, but we weren’t as witty as you.
In case you were wondering, this is a classic West Coast Style IPA.  Hop forward with a clean dry finish, a bit dank, just like Karl, and enough caramel malt to take the edge off, and leave you wanting for more.

You’ll see Starr washing windows at a quarter to four (cause he aint gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more,) and while we’re sure he’s mostly phoneless, thanks to you he sure ain’t homeless.  He’s got some mean brew’in skills, so he gave this Brewster a break and took a spin on the stainless, while singing Johnny Ryall. Johnny Rye Ale is what he produced. Now if you ask him to sing it, he will, over and over, and you may just have to give him fitty cents to stop.

101164,Künstler Brewing,2358722,Big Emma,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,7.2,42,"This wee heavy is elegant and strong, malt forward, and holds a hint of smoke. Drinking these big flavors may inspire you to hoist some big grain bags, but why would you?  Relax, and enjoy another.

Our daughter’s name is Emma.  She’s but a wee girl, but don’t let her fool you.  She’ll run circles around most guys when it’s time to unload pallets of grain, she’ll even throw in a few overhead squats with the grain sacks if she’s feeling fancy.  Our Emma is a girl of juxtaposition. She is one of few who can portray elegance and beauty while shamelessly downing a pile of smoky BBQ ribs. 

We decided to brew a beer to represent Emma.  Welcome Big Emma, it’s but a Wee Heavy.  It is Emma’s goal to bring fitness classes to our brewery. We really want to see this happen, because who doesn’t want to enjoy their favorite craft beer after a good workout? We are donating $1 of each pint sold towards gym equipment.

101164,Künstler Brewing,685795,Ghost Tracks Roasted Oatmeal Porter,Stout - Oatmeal,5.2,32,"For this brew, we roast the oats, then add just the right mix of grain to provide some good chocolate notes.  A sip starts sweet on the palate with a silky mouth feel. It finishes with that touch of chocolate, making you want more.  

Trains in the dark, haunting sounds of whistles blowing, wisps of tumbleweed, and maybe even the song of a Mockingbird, all inspires this brew. Our brewery is not haunted, (well not yet) but we do have train tracks out back.  It’s a good brew to sip while reading the ghostly children’s story in Legends of America – coincidently having nothing to do with train tracks.  Nonetheless, it is a story about ghost tracks and reflective of San Antonio…which was enough inspiration for us! Best of all, at 5.2 ABV, you can have several, which you will need in case you come across some other creepy stories on that Legends of America site.

So for a moment, don’t worry about Facebook, your next appointment, or your next beer,(okay well maybe don’t go quite so far) but enjoy these present seconds. 
Nulli Secundus is brewed with a hefty amount of Munich and Vienna malts, in addition to some chocolate malts. It is a true Lager, because it is brewed with lager yeast, and its lagered",3.904,280
101164,Künstler Brewing,2813090,The Viking,Fruit Beer,6.0,25,"This farmhouse ale has been fermented with a Century old Norwegian Yeast strain called Kveik –say it like kwike.  It means yeast in Norwegian dialect, and has been passed down generation to generation. 
The Vikings were known to drink a bit of beer, and we were wondering, if they had a choice, how would they really want it to look and taste?  And what would appeal to the female warrior? Therefore, we added some mango and hibiscus to make it look pretty, or like blood if you’re in a Viking kind of mood. 

Fun fact: The existence of warrior women in Viking culture has consistently been challenged in official histories. About a year ago an elaborate Viking Age grave in Sweden was found holding the remains of a decorated female warrior from the 10th century, providing the first archaeological evidence that women held high-status positions in Viking culture.  She was buried with trove of weapons and paraphernalia, and the DNA left little question as to the sex of the fighter.

101164,Künstler Brewing,2984295,Alone & Unafraid,IPA - Imperial / Double,8.3,66,"This double IPA was made with hops hand selected by a group of veteran-owned breweries from across the US, representing multiple branches of the US Armed Forces.  The blend is comprised of five different Pacific Northwest grown varieties, providing a beautiful mix of tropical citrus, and herbal aromas. Yakima Chief Hops’ Veterans Blend is dedicated to providing a fiscal donation of $3 per pound sold to a new veteran-support organization each year.  This year’s donation will be made to the Semper Fi Fund, which is dedicated to providing urgently needed resources and support for post 9/11 combat wounded, critically ill and catastrophically injured members of the United States Armed Forces and their families.  Featured hops: Cashmere, Centennial, Ekuanot, Mosaic, Simcoe.

Alone and Unafraid is code for when you’re trying to destroy a target, lost track of your flight lead, are split from the formation, not in communication to anyone on the radio, and have a high probability of dying because you’ve lost any kind of support.

JoJo assured me that she doesn’t really like beer., therefore I’m not sure what happened to the keg we took along to Terlingua one weekend.  It blew after only 24 hours.  JoJo speaks only French.

101164,Künstler Brewing,2891244,The Northman,IPA - International,6.0,55,"We fermented this farmhouse ale with the fascinating century old Norwegian Yeast strain called Kveik –say “kwike.”  It means yeast in Norwegian dialect, and has been passed down many generations. It likes to ferment hot, and our brewhouse accomodates. Aromas of honeydew, nectarine and kiwi, backed by citrussy clean flavors and a woodsy dryness.  The flavors are pretty crazy, considering that we fermented at almost 95 degrees. The Kveik chews through sugars in no time, so we added plenty of flaked grains for mouthfeel. There are very few Kveik IPAs out there, enjoy this one while it lasts.  

Originally we called it Norseman but after a beer or some we figured out that if you say it with a lisp, and is there anything more charming than a lisp, it’s Northman.  Northman immediately gives us visions of Eric, that tall, Nordic looking, 1000 year old vampire- and why wouldn’t it.  Northman is in the same category as Jason Statham when it comes to the few men that it is okay for straight men to have a crush on. What does Eric Northman have to do with beer you ask? Well nothing. But his name sure came in handy when we were desperate for a bad ass (and he is) name. We’re not saying this beer is as good as V or even Tru Blood, but it is pretty fantastic for human consumption (not the consumption of humans.)

7188,No Label Brewing Company,2023887,Cape Comorin,IPA - Imperial / Double,8.8,70,"This is a Rye Double IPA. It's base malt is mostly 2-row, a quarter Maris Otter, and about 10% rye, with a small bit of medium crystal (caramel) malts. It's bittering hop is cascade, and flavored with Amarillo, Chinook, and Citra.

Overall Impression: A hoppy, fairly strong pale ale. Somewhat malty, but not nearly as malty, or boozy, as an american barleywine. Strongly hopped, but the aroma leans towards fruity citrus and pine characteristics. Bitterness is not overly intense, but is very present. The rye adds a spicy and earthy character not usually present in this style. It sits a bit heavier than most DIPAs, which is by design. Color was originally a golden orange/yellow, but the addition of rye added a slightly more tan hue.",3.786,1308

Rude Jester combines the strong citrus qualities of the Centennial hop with tropical notes from the Mosaic hop to create a unique fruity hop flavor and a pungent, intoxicating hop aroma.

Ben, one of the founding members of True Anomaly, developed this tasty IPA long ago in the driveway of the TABCO brewing headquarters (aka his house).

10575,True Anomaly Brewing,3197976,Oliver Wilder,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,7.9,30,"Aged for approximately four months within one of our first-use foeders. Strong oak and a slight smoke comes through on both the nose and taste. Wood notes meld into the funk and spice undertones provided by the Brettanomyces yeast and substantial rye additions used in the grist. Mixed with our favorite French Saison yeast results in a lingering spice finish. 

Well before a single beer was produced under the name True Anomaly, Oliver Wilder, first son to David and the True Anomaly family, came into the world. David was instrumental in the development of many of the rye-forward beers we developed over the years, and this first-use foeder-aged rye release is the ideal beer to commemorate. ",3.865,342
10575,True Anomaly Brewing,3197968,Moonbow,American Wild Ale,7.0,40,"Foeder Aged, Dry Hopped, Fruited, American Wild Ale. Whew, let's unpack all of that. Aged for 3 months in our American Oak Foeders, this ale fermented with a mixed culture of yeast strains, including Brettanomyces, and our proprietary house culture. Heavy additions of peach during final aging impart sweet notes that balance the sour, and provide a bit of zest. Both funky and sour, this American Wild Ale is distinctly bold, evoking much of what True Anomaly hopes to bring to Houston. 

Moonbows are the rainbows. The Moon has to be no more than 42 degrees from the horizon. At Full Moon with an otherwise clear and dark sky. Any bright light will easily obscure it, and water droplets must be present in the air. ",3.846,342

We were thrilled to be involved in this amazing project this year.  We added one of our mixed cultures and fermented this for 4 months in a wood foeder.  It was then re-fermented with sweet and tart cherries. Cherries dominate up front with a backbone of tartness from the mixed culture fermentation and oak from the foeder.

Using Maris Otter as the base malt, this brew has notes reminiscent of graham crackers. Caramel and chocolate malts add slight sweetness and a rich malt character. The coffee is of Ethiopian descent and imparts notes of cranberries, blueberries, and roasted nuts that play well with the slightly fruity English yeast characters. This is a truly unique beer that will keep you buzzed in more ways than one.",3.699,371

The bitterness, as with all of our beers, is kept quite low for the style so that you can drink more than one without overwhelming your palate. There is a very light malt backbone to keep this beer in balance, but in the end it's all about the hops baby.",3.742,281
379699,White Rock Alehouse & Brewery,2761552,Weiz Ass Bass,Hefeweizen,4.8,13,Our take on this classic wheat beer style remains true to form. A balance of banana and clove esters are formed by the yeast during fermentation along with citrusy notes of fresh apricot. We used a ton of wheat which leaves the body extremely smooth and gives notes of freshly baked bread in the background. Low bitterness and a light flavor profile make this the perfect beer for summer.,3.624,234

The result is an even smoother, juicier beer. The dry hops consist of Mosaic, Ella (from Australia), Simcoe Cryo, and Citra Cryo which come together to create a tropical fruit bowl of aromas and flavors. If you haven’t heard of Cryo hops yet, you’re missing out. These little beauties are a concentrated form of hops that removes a portion of the leaf material, giving a more intense hop flavor. We hope you enjoy this tropical treat. ",3.861,137

In line with the West Coast style, we utilized a clean fermenting house yeast to minimize ester production and a gypsum rich water profile thus allowing the focus to be on the resiny hop profile.
